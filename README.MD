# CCAI Insights Notes
A super basic demo to show how conversation flow from CCAI to insights
Part one - bash script, using ES rest apis (conevrsation, participents, interactions)
This is also where the project is setup:
- enable services
- create service account and give it dialogFlow admin
- create Sample Agent if you don't provide agent ID

Part 2 - python notebook to demo python and CX apis
Python notebook with CX sdk
